Contact Section doesn't contain any form currently but i'm thinking of building a responsive design with only HTML and CSS. Was planning on building one with PHP but didn't really have time to put in learning the language. I am also trying to consider different other types of frameworks but we will see. For the mean time i will stick to the basics as i go along and i guess and maybe a little more advanced once i already get the hang of these technologies.
